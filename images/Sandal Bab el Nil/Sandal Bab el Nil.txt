Sandals are smaller versions of the majestic Dahabiya but you still get the same attention to detail. Simply, yet comfortably, furnished Bab el Nil offers you a 6 berth sandal on a 17 meter vessel with 2 large twin cabins and 1 large double cabin. They all have their own in-suite shower facilities and plenty of wardrobe space.
The deck has plenty of room for sunbathing and traditional floor cushions for relaxing. The salon is cozy and doubles up as a dining area when the nights are too cold for evening dining on the deck.
