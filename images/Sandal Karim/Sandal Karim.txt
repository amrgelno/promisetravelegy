Karim has the same generous proportions as Bab el Nil and measures 17 meters in length. This converted freight sailing vessel has 3 good sized cabins of which 2 are twins and share a shower room and 1 a much larger twin with its own in-suite shower room.
This wonderfully colorful sandal has a good sized deck with sun loungers and deck chairs for sun worshipers and plenty of shaded seating for those wishing to chat, relax or just enjoy the wonderful tranquil life passing by on the river banks. The salon is well equipped with seating and for dining on those cooler evenings. This very traditional boat is ideal for families and those wishing for a more intimate setting.
