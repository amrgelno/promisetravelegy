El Gourna is the largest of our sandals, catering for 12 people, and measures 23 meters long. There are 6 cabins, 4 are twin rooms and 2 are double rooms all with their own in-suite shower facilities. Each cabin is bright and airy, tastefully decorated and comes complete with crisp Egyptian cotton bed linen. The deck has plenty of seating should you wish to relax on one of the comfortable sofas or catch a bit of sun in the deck chairs.
Generally all meals are taken on deck but should the guests find the night air too cool then there is ample room in the salon below which, although small is very cozy with plenty of seating.
